## API

### force-require(&lt;String&gt;, [cb])

Try to load a dependency based in the name. If `cb` is provided then the call will be resolved follow async interface.

Internally the library follow the next algorithm:

1) Try to require the dependency locally. This means that exists in the current `process.cwd()/node_modules` folder
as direct dependency or a dependency of another dependency.

2) If not possible to resolve locally, then try to resolve globally in your system. Try to require the dependency globally
using the module [global-modules](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/global-modules).

3) At this poin of the algorithm, the dependency was not found. Let's install as global module and later require it.
